}, {
  question: "What documents do I need for my policy review?",
  answer: "Just bring your existing policy documents (health, life, motor, or any other insurance). Your PadosiAgent will review your coverage, identify gaps, check if you're overpaying, and suggest optimizations — all for free."
}, {
  question: "Can I find a PadosiAgent who speaks my language?",
  answer: "Yes! Each PadosiAgent profile shows the languages they speak. You can easily find your PadosiAgent who communicates in Hindi, English, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, or other regional languages."
